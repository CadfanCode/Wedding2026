                        North Wales is an amazingly beautiful area and has been voted one of the

                        in the world to travel. However, travelling here can be a little tricky, so we’ve provided some details below to make it as simple as possible. 
                        If you plan on staying in North Wales for longer than a few days, we recommend <strong>hiring a car</strong> to make the most of what the region has to offer! 
                        Don’t worry if this isn’t an option—there are still plenty of places that can be reached by <strong>train</strong> and a few short <strong>taxi rides</strong>!

                    <p>
                        Use Google Maps. From Manchester: Follow <strong>M56 and A55</strong> to Holyhead/Caergybi, exit 8A at Britannia Bridge, then A5 towards Beaumaris. 
                        Chateau Rhianfa is halfway between Beaumaris and the bridge. Roads are narrow—drive carefully!
