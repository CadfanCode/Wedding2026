                       The wedding will be held in North Wales, specifically at <a href="https://chateaurhianfa.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chateau Rhianfa</a> on the Isle of Anglesey.
                       North Wales is a rural area that is not so well connected to the rest of the UK, so we recommend planning your travel in advance. Below we have listed some options for getting to the wedding venue. By car is recommended,
                       otherwise a train and taxi combination is the next best option.             
                    </p>               
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-plane"></i> By Air</h3>

                        <a href="https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Manchester Airport:</strong></a> The largest international airport with car rental and train services easily accessible. 
                        The venue is approximately a 1-hour 45-minute drive or 2 hours 45 minutes to 4 hours by train.

                        <a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/" target="_target"><strong>Dublin Airport:</strong></a> An alternative for those that may want to spend a few days in Ireland before making the short
                         ferry journey over the Irish Sea to North Wales.  
                    </p><br>

                        <a href="https://www.liverpoolairport.com/" target="_target"><strong>Liverpool Airport:</strong></a> This is technically the closest airport although it is a minor airport with fewer international
                        flights. Transport from Liverpool airport to North Wales requires a little more effort as there is no train station immediately available to the airport itself. Although buses and taxes can take 
                        you from the airport and into the city to catch any trains.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-ship"></i> By Sea</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you're travelling from Ireland you can catch one of the regular ferries from <strong>Dublin to Holyhead</strong> (Isle of Anglesey) take 2 hours 15 minutes to 3 hours 30 minutes. However be warned
                    that ferries can sometimes (but not often) be cancelled due to strong seas. When you arrive at Holyhead you can take a 40-minute taxi to the venue or a train to Bangor (Gwynedd) with a shorter taxi trip
                       of 15 mins to the venue. </p><br>

                        Free guest parking is available at the venue. For those staying overnight at a different location, make sure you check 
                        parking arrangements with your hotel, as not all have customer parking.
                    </p>
            
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-train"></i> By Train</h3>
                    <p>
                        Travel to <strong>Bangor (Gwynedd)</strong> via <a href="https://www.mytrainpal.com/" target="_blank">train</a>, 
                        then take a short taxi to the venue.<br> 
                        We recommend against travelling to Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch as trains often only stop here upon request; which may be a difficult feat for non-Welsh speakers!

                        Like we say we in Wales: <italics> Mae bysiau yn fel rhech mewn pot jam! (The Buses are as useful as fart in a jam jar!)</italics>.
                        Taking a bus to in North Wales can also be a bit of a challenge, as the bus services are not as reliable and bus stops are not always clearly marked. Although they kinda work if you want to take yourself to larger towns like Bangor, Llandudno or Caernarfon.

                            <p> Linnéa met Cai in 2022 while he was training at the Swedish police academy and she was studying to become a nurse. 
                            They hit it off immediately, bonding over their shared love for outdoor adventures, training, dogs and hiking. When Cai had to move to Stockholm, Linnéa soon followed, 
                            and they began building a life together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            They enjoyed several adventures. Exploring the mountains in Cai's homeland of North Wales, cycling adventures in Tuscany and hiking in the Swedish fjälls.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Cai had been secretly planning to propose for months. His first attempt came in November 2023 atop Tryfan in North Wales, but stormy weather ruined the moment. The backup plan—a cosy cottage proposal—also fizzled after a celebratory night out left them too hungover to do anything but eat snacks.

                            <p>
                            Five months later, while skiing 108 km across the Arctic Circle, Cai finally got the moment he’d been waiting for. At Tjäktja Pass, he popped the question—and this time, everything went to plan.
