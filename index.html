        <h3>Croeso i'r Gogledd Cymru!</h3>
        <p>
            North Wales is an amazingly beautiful area and has been voted one of the 
            <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-in-travel-2017-top-10-regions" target="_blank">top 10 regions</a> 
            in the world to travel. However, travelling here can be a little tricky, so we’ve provided some details 
            below to make it as simple as possible. If you plan on staying in North Wales for longer than a few days, 
            we recommend hiring a car to make the most of what the region has to offer! Don’t worry if this isn’t an 
            option—there are still plenty of places that can be reached by train and a few short taxi rides!
        </p>

        <h3>Travel Options</h3>
        
        <h4>By Air</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/" target="_blank"> <strong>Manchester Airport:</strong> </a>
                Manchester Airport is the largest international 
                airport with car rental and train services easily accessible 
                from the airport. The venue is approximately a 1-hour 45-minute drive from the airport. Train times 
                vary from 2 hours 45 minutes (direct) to 4 hours (with changes).
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Dublin Airport:</strong></a>
                If you want to avoid England or stop off in Ireland along the way, 
                Dublin Airport</a> is an alternative. Ireland’s largest 
                international airport offers frequent 
                <a href="https://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/routes-and-times/dublin-holyhead/" target="_blank">ferry crossings</a> 
                to Wales.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Sea</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                There are regular ferry crossings from Dublin to Holyhead (Isle of Anglesey) with crossing times 
                varying between 2 hours 15 minutes and 3 hours 30 minutes. Ferry operators include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/routes-and-times/dublin-holyhead/" target="_blank">Irish Ferries</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.stenaline.co.uk/routes/holyhead-dublin" target="_blank">Stena Line</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Upon arrival at Holyhead ferry terminal, you can either take a taxi (45 minutes) directly to the 
                venue or take a train to Bangor (Gwynedd) and then a taxi for the remaining distance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Car</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                We recommend using Google Maps, but if you’re still living in the 1990s, here are some details:
            </p>
            <h5>From Manchester</h5>
            <p>
                Follow the M56 and North Wales Expressway/A55 to Holyhead/Caergybi. Take exit 8A when you cross 
                Britannia Bridge and follow the A5 towards Beaumaris. Chateau Rhianfa is located on the side of 
                the road halfway between Beaumaris and Britannia Bridge. Caution should be taken when driving as 
                the roads are narrow and winding, and the entrance to Chateau Rhianfa is easy to miss.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Train</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                If you travel by <a href="https://www.mytrainpal.com/" target="_blank"></a>train</a>, we recommend going to Bangor (Gwynedd) and taking a taxi the short distance 
                to the venue. We advise against taking the train to 
                Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch (Isle of Anglesey) as trains 
                usually only stop upon request—which isn’t helped by the obviously difficult-to-pronounce name.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Bus</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                Don’t do it. Public transport in North Wales is notoriously useless (fel rhech mewn pot jam!).
            </p>
        </div>

<h3>Accommodation Options</h3>

<h4><a href="https://chateaurhianfa.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chateau Rhianfa (Isle of Anglesey)</a></h4>
<p>If you really want to make the most of your time at the wedding and party, then we would strongly recommend spending the night of the wedding at Chateau Rhianfa. 
    The venue has kindly booked off a few rooms for the night of the wedding. Parking included. So if you're interested in staying here then please contact us at: caiowain@gmail.com or 
    contact Chateau Rhianfa and simply explain that you'll be attending our wedding.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://y-capel-guest-house.hotels-wales.com/" target="_blank">Y Capel (Conwy)</a></h4>
<p>As the name suggests, Y Capel (The Chapel) is a converted chapel in the center of the medieval castle town of Conwy. There are several fantastic pubs here (Albion, the Bank, Erskine Arms) 
    where you'll probably find the groom after hiking in the mountains. There is also a phenomenal (but pricey!) fine dining restaurant within the town walls (<a href="https://www.thejackdawconwy.co.uk/">The Jackdaw</a>) 
    and you can take a walk on the sandy beach of Conwy Morfa and enjoy a Michelin-recommended dish at <a href="https://darwinescapes.co.uk/aberconwy-resort-spa/facilities/signatures-restaurant/">Signatures restaurant</a>. Nearby you can also visit the groom's hometown of Llandudno.<br> 
    The guesthouse is exceptionally close to Conwy train station, but please be aware of the train times for your return journey unless you plan to take a taxi back. Parking is available although be aware that parking is very limited due to the very small size of the car park. 
</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.coedmawrhall.com/" target="_blank">Coed Mawr (Rowen)</a></h4>
<p>If you have a car and want the peace and quiet of the countryside, you can stay at the tranquil Coed Mawr Hall: a favourite of the bride. The building is a stylishly renovated manor 
    tucked away in the Conwy valley. Here you can enjoy country walks down country tracks and enjoy a slower pace of life. There are no amenities near this location, so a car is a must
    to have a chance of reaching civilization.
</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/674344312840506449?viralityEntryPoint=1&s=76&source_impression_id=p3_1741801514_P3_d22ZG-bPr2TW8" target="_blank">Crusty AirBnB hosted by the groom's best man</a></h4>
<p>Intending to stay in North Wales for more than just a few days? You may want to consider contacting the Best Man of the groom who has several AirBnB properties in the nearby town of
    Bangor, a short taxi ride away. Bangor is a student town that empties during the summer months. It serves as an excellent hub to explore Eryri (Snowdonia) or the West Coast of Wales.
