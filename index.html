        <h3>Croeso i'r Gogledd Cymru!</h3>
        <p>
            North Wales is an amazingly beautiful area and has been voted one of the 
            <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-in-travel-2017-top-10-regions">top 10 regions</a> 
            in the world to travel. However, travelling here can be a little tricky, so we’ve provided some details 
            below to make it as simple as possible. If you plan on staying in North Wales for longer than a few days, 
            we recommend hiring a car to make the most of what the region has to offer! Don’t worry if this isn’t an 
            option—there are still plenty of places that can be reached by train and a few short taxi rides!
        </p>

        <h3>The Venue</h3>
        <p>
            The wedding and reception will be held at Chateau Rhianfa on the Isle of Anglesey in North Wales.
        </p>

        <h3>Travel Options</h3>
        
        <h4>By Air</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/"> <strong>Manchester Airport:</strong> </a>
                Manchester Airport is the largest international 
                airport with car rental and train services easily accessible 
                from the airport. The venue is approximately a 1-hour 45-minute drive from the airport. Train times 
                vary from 2 hours 45 minutes (direct) to 4 hours (with changes).
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/"><strong>Dublin Airport:</strong></a>
                If you want to avoid England or stop off in Ireland along the way, 
                Dublin Airport</a> is an alternative. Ireland’s largest 
                international airport offers frequent 
                <a href="https://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/routes-and-times/dublin-holyhead/">ferry crossings</a> 
                to Wales.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Sea</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                There are regular ferry crossings from Dublin to Holyhead (Isle of Anglesey) with crossing times 
                varying between 2 hours 15 minutes and 3 hours 30 minutes. Ferry operators include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/routes-and-times/dublin-holyhead/">Irish Ferries</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.stenaline.co.uk/routes/holyhead-dublin">Stena Line</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Upon arrival at Holyhead ferry terminal, you can either take a taxi (45 minutes) directly to the 
                venue or take a train to Bangor (Gwynedd) and then a taxi for the remaining distance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Car</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                We recommend using Google Maps, but if you’re still living in the 1990s, here are some details:
            </p>
            <h5>From Manchester</h5>
            <p>
                Follow the M56 and North Wales Expressway/A55 to Holyhead/Caergybi. Take exit 8A when you cross 
                Britannia Bridge and follow the A5 towards Beaumaris. Chateau Rhianfa is located on the side of 
                the road halfway between Beaumaris and Britannia Bridge. Caution should be taken when driving as 
                the roads are narrow and winding, and the entrance to Chateau Rhianfa is easy to miss.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Train</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                If you travel by <a href="https://www.mytrainpal.com/"></a>train</a>, we recommend going to Bangor (Gwynedd) and taking a taxi the short distance 
                to the venue. We advise against taking the train to 
                Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch (Isle of Anglesey) as trains 
                usually only stop upon request—which isn’t helped by the obviously difficult-to-pronounce name.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>By Bus</h4>
        <div class="travel-option">
            <p>
                Don’t do it. Public transport in North Wales is notoriously useless (fel rhech mewn pot jam!).
