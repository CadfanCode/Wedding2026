                       The wedding will be held in North Wales, specifically at <a href="https://chateaurhianfa.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chateau Rhianfa</a> on the Isle of Anglesey.
                       North Wales is a rural area that is not so well connected to the rest of the UK, so we recommend planning your travel in advance. Below we have listed some options for getting to the wedding venue. By car is recommended,
                       otherwise a train and taxi combination is the next best option.             
                    </p>               
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-plane"></i> By Air</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Manchester Airport:</strong></a> The largest international airport with car rental and train services easily accessible. 
                        The venue is approximately a 1-hour 45-minute drive or 2 hours 45 minutes to 4 hours by train. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/" target="_target"><strong>Dublin Airport:</strong></a> An alternative for those that may want to spend a few days in Ireland before making the short
                         ferry journey over the Irish Sea to North Wales.  
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.liverpoolairport.com/" target="_target"><strong>Liverpool Airport:</strong></a> This is technically the closest airport although it is a minor airport with fewer international
                        flights. Transport from Liverpool airport to North Wales requires a little more effort as there is no train station at the airport. Although buses and taxis can take 
                        you from the airport and into the city, where you can then take a train.
                    </p>
            
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-ship"></i> By Sea</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you're travelling from Ireland you can catch one of the regular ferries from <strong>Dublin to Holyhead</strong>. The ferry journey takes between 2 hours 15 minutes to 3 hours 30 minutes depending on which ferry you book. However be warned
                    that ferries can sometimes (but not often) be cancelled due to strong seas. When you arrive at Holyhead you can take a 40-minute taxi to the venue or take a train directly from the ferry terminal to Bangor (Gwynedd) with a shorter taxi trip
                       of 15 mins to the venue. </p><br>

                    <p>
                        Free guest parking is available at the venue. For those staying overnight at a different location, make sure you check 
                        parking arrangements with your hotel, as not all have customer parking.
                    </p>
            
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-train"></i> By Train</h3>
                    <p>
                        Travel to <strong>Bangor (Gwynedd)</strong> via <a href="https://www.mytrainpal.com/" target="_blank">train</a>, 
                        then it is just a short taxi ride to the venue.<br> 
                        We recommend against travelling to Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch as trains often only stop here upon request; which may be a difficult feat for non-Welsh speakers!

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-bus"></i> By Bus</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like we say we in Wales: <italics> Mae bysiau yn fel rhech mewn pot jam! (The Buses are as useful as fart in a jam jar!)</italics>.
                        Taking a bus to in North Wales can also be a bit of a challenge, as the bus services are not reliable and bus stops are not always clearly marked. Although they kinda work if you want to take yourself to larger towns, such as Bangor, Llandudno or Caernarfon.

                    <h3>What is the dresscode?</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Wear your finest and we kindly ask that you avoid wearing trainers, except if you plan to change into them for dancing in the evening.
                        Ladies avoid wearing white.

                        Most importantly we want you to feel comfortable and to enjoy yourselves!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Is the wedding indoors or outdoors?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If the weather is good; the ceremony will be outdoors. Otherwise it'll be indoors. Regardless, the guests are free to wander the gardens and enjoy the views.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What time should I arrive?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Aim to arrive at the venue between 12:00-12:30 PM. The ceremony will start at 1PM, followed by food, drinks, games and dancing!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I go for a swim the Menai Straits?</h3>
                    <p> No, it is an extremely dangerous stretch of water, so just don't. However, if you want to cool off in the sea, there are plenty of beautiful beaches across North Wales! e.g. Traeth Llanddwyn,
                         Traeth Benllech, Traeth Trearddur, Abersoch & Aberdaron.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can I walk to and from the venue?</h3>
                    <p> It is not recommended to walk to and from the venue as the footpath is narrow and cars travel quickly along the winding road. A taxi ride is an inexpensive and safe option.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Is it okay to take pictures with our phones and cameras during the wedding?</h3>
                    <p>You are welcome to take photographs <u>after</u> the ceremony. During the ceremony we kindly ask that you refrain from taking photographs or films. A bespoke app will also be available to download,
                     that will allow you to upload your photos and videos to a shared album, so that everyone can enjoy the memories of the day!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Will food be served?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Our aim is that everyone is comfortable and well fed. If you have any allergies or dietary requirements make sure to let us know when you RSVP.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Do I have to pay for parking?</h3>
                    <p>Parking at Chateau Rhianfa is free for guests.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Is there a bar?</h3>
                    <p>Yes there is! Once you have exhausted your allocation of complimentary wine, you're welcome to purchase additional drinks at the bar. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Can my children come?</h3>
                    <p>As much as we love your little ones, we are unable to accommodate children. Plus we want you to be able to let your hair down and enjoy the day child-free.
                    </p>
                    <h3>But what if I can't find a nanny?</h3>
                    <p>Anglesey boasts many ancient sacrificial stones that may also be an appealing alternative!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Is there a wedding gift list?</h3>
                    <p>No, celebrating the big day with our nearest and dearest is all we wish for. <i>Canu efo fi rŵan!...nid wy'n gofyn bywyd moethus, etc.</i>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Is there anywhere we should avoid?</h3>
                    <p>Rhyl. If you know, you know. Allow it fam.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Is the best-man a respectable gentleman?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely not! This man a scoundrel with an insatiable appetite for mischief and depravity. His words are not to be trusted for they are laced with lies and deceit. 
                        Small animals and loved ones should be kept away from him at all times, lest they fall victim to his vile ways.
                    <h3>Will there be music?</h3>
                    <p>Oh yes, all the music you can shake your bootay to! We have a live band lined up to keep the party going all night long.

                            <p> Linnéa met Cai in 2022 while he was training at the Swedish police academy and she was studying to become a nurse. Enchanted by Cai's dashing good looks and charming personality, 
                                Linnéa was powerless to resist his appeal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                            They hit it off immediately, bonding over their shared love for outdoor adventures, training, dogs and hiking. When Cai had to move to Stockholm, Linnéa soon followed, 
                            and they began building a life together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Since then they have gone on several adventures together, often suffering along the way. They have cycled through Tuscany on wildly inappropriate bicycles, explored the mountains of North Wales and hiked the wild Swedish fjälls. But it was whilst skiing 108km
                            across the arctic circle in Lappland that Cai finally proposed to Linnéa, at Tjäktja Pass, after months of planning. Miles away from civilization and with Cai carrying all the essential supplies,
                            Linnéa was in no position to say no, lest face certain doom in the freezing tundra of Lappand. So she wisely said yes, and they celebrated shortly after with a chocolate bar. Chin-chin!
