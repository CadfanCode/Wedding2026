                <h2>Travel & Accommodation</h2>
                <h3>Croeso i'r Gogledd Cymru!</h3>
                <p>North Wales is an amazingly beautiful area and voted as one of the <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-in-travel-2017-top-10-regions"> 
                top 10 regions </a> in the world to travel. However travelling here can be a little tricky, so we've provided some details below to help make it as simple
                as possible. If you plan on staying in North Wales for longer than a few days, we would recommend hiring a car in order to make the most of what the region
                has to offer! Don't worry if this isn't the case, there are still plenty of places that can be reached by train and a few short taxi rides!</p>
                <h3>The Venue</h3>
                <p>The Wedding and reception will be held at Chateau Rhianfa on the Isle of Anglesey in North Wales.</p>
                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <h4>By air</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/">Manchester Airport</a> is the largest international airport with car rental and <a href="https://www.mytrainpal.com/">
                    train services </a> easily accessable from the airport. The venue is approximately 1hr 45mins drive from the airport. Train times vary between from 2hr 45mins (direct) to 4hrs (with changes).
                </p>
                <p><a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/">Dublin Airport</a> if you want to avoid England or if you just want to stop off in Ireland along the way, Dublin airport can also 
                be an alternative. Dublin is Irelands largest international airport and <a href="https://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/routes-and-times/dublin-holyhead/"> ferry crossings </a> to Wales are 
                frequent.
                </p>
                <h4>By Sea</h4>
                <p>There are regular ferry crossings from Dublin to Holyhead (Isle of Anglesey) with crossing times that vary between 2hrs 15 mins to 3hr 30mins. Ferry operators include:
                    <ul>
                        <a href="https://www.irishferries.com/uk-en/routes-and-times/dublin-holyhead/"><li>irishferries</li></a>
                        <a href="https://www.stenaline.co.uk/routes/holyhead-dublin"><li>irishferries</li></a>
                    </ul>
                Upon arrival at Holyhead ferry terminal you can either take a taxi (45mins) directly to the venue or take a train to Bangor (Gwynedd) and take a taxi the remaining distance.
                </p>
                <h4>By car</h4>
                <p>We recommend using Google Maps but if you're still living in the 1990's; we have included some details below.</p>
                <h5>From Manchester</h5>
                <p>Follow M56 and N Wales Expy/A55 to Holyhead/Caergybi. Take exit 8A when you cross Britannia Bridge and follow the A5 towards Beaumaris. Chateau Rhianfa is located on the side of the road half way 
                    between Beaumaris and Brittania Bridge. Caution should be taken when driving at the roads narrow, winding and the entrance to Chateau Rhianfa is easy to pass.
                </p>
                <h4>By Train</h4>
                <p>If you travel by train we recommend travelling to Bangor (Gwynedd) and taking a taxi the short distance to the venue. <br>
                    We recommend against getting the train to to Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch (Isle of Anglesey) as trains will usually only stop upon request...which isn't helped by 
                    the obviously difficult to pronounciate name.</p>
                <h4>By Bus</h4>
                <p>Don't do it. Public transport in North Wales is notoriously useless (fel rhech mewn pot jam!)</p>
