                        in the world to travel. However, travelling here can be a little tricky, so we’ve provided some details below to make it as simple as possible. 
                        If you plan on staying in North Wales for longer than a few days, we recommend hiring a car to make the most of what the region has to offer! 
                        Don’t worry if this isn’t an option—there are still plenty of places that can be reached by train and a few short taxi rides!

                     of 15 mins to the venue. </p><br>
